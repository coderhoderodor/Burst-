## Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: iOS 14.0+
- **Language**: Swift 5.0
- **Framework**: SpriteKit (2D game rendering)
- **Orientation**: Portrait only
- **Devices**: iPhone and iPad support
- **Performance**: 60 FPS target

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 13.0 or later
- iOS 14.0+ deployment target
- Apple Developer account (for device deployment)

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BalloonShooter.git
   cd BalloonShooter
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open BalloonShooter.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Select a target device or simulator**
   - Choose your device from the device selector in Xcode
   - For simulator: Select any iPhone or iPad simulator

4. **Build and run**
   - Press `Cmd + R` or click the Play button
   - The app will compile and launch on your selected device/simulator

### Configuration

- **Bundle Identifier**: Change `com.example.BalloonShooter` in project settings to your own
- **Development Team**: Set your Apple Developer team in Signing & Capabilities
- **App Icons**: Add custom app icons to `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Controls

1. **Aim**: Touch and drag anywhere on screen to pull back the bow
2. **Power**: Pull back further for more power and distance
3. **Shoot**: Release to fire the arrow
4. **Trajectory**: A dotted line shows the predicted arrow path (while aiming)

### Scoring System

- **Base Points**: Each balloon type has its own point value
- **Combo Multiplier**: Chain hits without missing to increase multiplier
- **Wave Bonus**: Complete waves for bonus points (Wave # × 50)
- **Accuracy Bonus**: Higher accuracy yields better ratings

### Difficulty Scaling

As waves progress:
- More balloons spawn simultaneously (up to 6)
- Bomb balloon ratio increases (30% → 50%)
- Balloons may move faster and be smaller
- Special balloon types appear more frequently

## Development Phases

The game was implemented in 5 phases following the PRD:

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Core shooting mechanics, single balloon, basic scoring
2. **Phase 2**: Bomb balloons, health system, risk-reward gameplay
3. **Phase 3**: Wave system, difficulty progression, combo scoring
4. **Phase 4**: Balloon variety (7 types), strategic depth
5. **Phase 5**: Power-ups, visual/audio polish, multiple game modes

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:

- [ ] Boss balloons with special patterns
- [ ] Environmental hazards (wind, obstacles)
- [ ] Different bow types with unique properties
- [ ] Seasonal events and themed balloons
- [ ] Multiplayer async competition
- [ ] Daily challenges and missions
- [ ] Achievement system
- [ ] Game Center leaderboards integration
- [ ] Customization (bow skins, arrow effects)
- [ ] Sound effects and background music
- [ ] iCloud sync for progress

## Known Limitations

- **Particle Textures**: The game references a "spark" particle texture that needs to be created as an actual image file. Currently uses a placeholder.
- **Audio**: Sound effects are not implemented (AudioManager is a stub)
- **Game Center**: Leaderboard integration not yet implemented
- **Social Sharing**: Share functionality shows a placeholder message

## Performance Notes

- Target frame rate: 60 FPS
- Optimized for iPhone X and later
- Tested on iOS 14.0+
- Physics simulation uses SpriteKit's built-in engine
- Particle systems are optimized with limited particle counts

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for bugs and feature requests.

## Credits

- **Design**: Based on the Balloon Shooter PRD
- **Development**: Implemented with SpriteKit and Swift
- **Inspiration**: Angry Birds (trajectory aiming), Fruit Ninja (arcade action)

## Quick Start Guide

### First Time Playing

1. Launch the app
2. Select a game mode (Arcade recommended for beginners)
3. Touch and drag to aim the bow
4. Release to shoot arrows at balloons
5. Pop regular balloons (🎈) for points
6. Avoid hitting bomb balloons (💣) or they'll drop bombs
7. Collect shield balloons (🛡️) for protection
8. Chain hits for combo multipliers
9. Complete waves to progress in difficulty

### Tips for Success

- **Look before you shoot**: Identify bomb balloons before firing
- **Build combos**: Consecutive hits increase your score multiplier
- **Use slow motion**: Pull back fully for precision shots
- **Collect shields**: They save you from one bomb hit
- **Aim for golden balloons**: Worth 5x normal points
- **Master the arc**: Arrows follow realistic physics

### High Score Strategies

1. Prioritize golden and speed balloons for maximum points
2. Maintain combo chains by never missing
3. Complete waves quickly for time bonuses
4. Use power-ups strategically in tough situations
5. Save shields for emergency situations
6. Practice trajectory prediction for better accuracy
